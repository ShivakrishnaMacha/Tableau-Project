This project provides an in-depth analysis of employment and wage data from various industries and regions, based on the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages dataset from the New York State Government's open data portal. The visualization aims to offer valuable insights into industry dynamics, labor market trends, and regional economic performance.

## Project Overview
