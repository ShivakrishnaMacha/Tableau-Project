# Tableau-Project
This project analyzes employment and wage data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) dataset, provided by the New York State Government. Using Tableau, we visualize key trends in industry dynamics, labor market health, and regional economic performance, aiming to inform policy recommendations and business strategies.
